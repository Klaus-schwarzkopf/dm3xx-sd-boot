The DM36x directory contains files needed for the DM365

DM365 Silicon supports NAND devices with page sizes of 512 bytes/page, 2K bytes/page, and 4K bytes/page.
8k bytes/page devices are not available at the moment so they cannot be tested
DM365 Silicon uses a NAND layout for big block NAND devices with a page size of 2K bytes per page as follows:
               2048 bytes data
               64 bytes spare byte area

DM365 Silicon uses a NAND layout for big block NAND devices with a page size of 4K bytes per page as follows:
               4096 bytes data
               128 bytes spare byte area

the data is not broken into chunks of 512 bytes of data separated by 16 bytes of OOB data
